If you inspect rendered page using browser developer tools or if you open one of the build HTML files, you can find out,
that texts are rendered and are part of static content.

In development mode (if you add an API key in your .env file) texts will be loaded from Tolgee REST API, and so you
would be able to modify the localization data in real time.
